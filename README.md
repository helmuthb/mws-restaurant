## Build the project

The project uses `gulp` and `node` together with some other modules for performance optimization.

You will need `node` and `npm` installed first.
Then, start with adding the required modules:
```
npm install
```

To build, call
```
npx gulp
```
which will create the opimized version in `dist/`.
